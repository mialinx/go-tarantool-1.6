# Client in Go for Tarantool

The package `go-tarantool` contains everything you need to connect to
[Tarantool 1.6+][tarantool-site].

The advantage of integrating Go with Tarantool, which is an application server
plus a DBMS, is that Go programmers can handle databases and perform on-the-fly
recompilations of embedded Lua routines, just as in C, with responses that are
faster than other packages according to public benchmarks.

## Installation

We assume that you have Tarantool version 1.6+ and a modern Linux or BSD
operating system.

You need a current version of `go`, version 1.13 or later (use `go version` to
check the version number). Do not use `gccgo-go`.

**Note:** If your `go` version is older than 1.3 or if `go` is not installed,
download and run the latest tarball from [golang.org][golang-dl].

The package `go-tarantool` is located in [tarantool/go-tarantool][go-tarantool]
repository. To download and install, say:

```
$ go get github.com/tarantool/go-tarantool
```

This should put the source and binary files in subdirectories of
`/usr/local/go`, so that you can access them by adding
`github.com/tarantool/go-tarantool` to the `import {...}` section at the start
of any Go program.

<h2>API reference</h2>

Read the [Tarantool documentation](tarantool-doc-data-model-url)
to find descriptions of terms such as "connect", "space", "index", and the
requests to create and manipulate database objects or Lua functions.

In general, connector methods can be divided into two main parts:

* `Connect()` function and functions related to connecting, and
* Data manipulation functions and Lua invocations such as `Insert()` or `Call()`.

The supported requests have parameters and results equivalent to requests in
the [Tarantool CRUD operations](tarantool-doc-box-space-url).
There are also Typed and Async versions of each data-manipulation function.

## Walking-through example in Go

We can now have a closer look at the `example.go` program and make some observations
about what it does.

```go
package main

import (
     "fmt"
     "github.com/tarantool/go-tarantool"
)

func main() {
   opts := tarantool.Opts{User: "guest"}
   conn, err := tarantool.Connect("127.0.0.1:3301", opts)
   // conn, err := tarantool.Connect("/path/to/tarantool.socket", opts)
   if err != nil {
       fmt.Println("Connection refused:", err)
   }
   resp, err := conn.Insert(999, []interface{}{99999, "BB"})
   if err != nil {
     fmt.Println("Error", err)
     fmt.Println("Code", resp.Code)
   }
}
```

**Observation 1:** the line "`github.com/tarantool/go-tarantool`" in the
`import(...)` section brings in all Tarantool-related functions and structures.

**Observation 2:** the line beginning with "`Opts :=`" sets up the options for
`Connect()`. In this example, there is only one thing in the structure, a user
name. The structure can also contain:

* `Pass` (password),
* `Timeout` (maximum number of milliseconds to wait before giving up),
* `Reconnect` (number of seconds to wait before retrying if a connection fails),
* `MaxReconnect` (maximum number of times to retry).

**Observation 3:** the line containing "`tarantool.Connect`" is essential for
beginning any session. There are two parameters:

* a string with `host:port` format, and
* the option structure that was set up earlier.

**Observation 4:** the `err` structure will be `nil` if there is no error,
otherwise it will have a description which can be retrieved with `err.Error()`.

**Observation 5:** the `Insert` request, like almost all requests, is preceded by
"`conn.`" which is the name of the object that was returned by `Connect()`.
There are two parameters:

* a space number (it could just as easily have been a space name), and
* a tuple.
